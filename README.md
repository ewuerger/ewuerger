My name is Ernst and I'm a german developer living in Berlin. I'm an active open source contributor and part of the SET circle of DB Netz AG for supporting the digitization of Germany's and Europe's national railways. My focus is set to solving complex puzzles which generate value, probably induced by my early lego-building addiction and study of mathematics and financial engineering at TU Berlin. My signature hero passive is: Perseverance.
